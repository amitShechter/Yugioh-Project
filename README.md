# My Summer Project

Hello and welcome to my first web application.
Yugioh is a card-game based on a Tv series. For more information, you can look at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!

This app helps Yugi-Oh! TCG (Trading Card Game) players to keep trackof their card prices.
As I am a competitive Yugioh player and an ambitious Computer Science student, I've decided to combine both of my passions and build a Web Application.

I've collected data of the Top-50 Cards that were sold in USA last year focusing on each card prices during 01/05/22 - 31/08/22.
After collecting the data, I've build models for each card in order to predict what would be his price.

This app allows the user to add yugioh cards from the marketplace to his own account and keep track of how many cards he has from each.
Also, it allows the user to compare the prices of each card during that time in reference to the prices that I've predicted.

You would see that some of these prices are (suprisingly) accurate and some are not.
